# Ping Pong Game in Scratch 3

A simple 1-player ping pong game built using Scratch 3. This project demonstrates core game development concepts like collision detection, scoring, and game-over logic, using Scratch’s visual programming environment.

## 🎮 Features
- Paddle controlled by player (keyboard)
- Ball bounces off paddles
- Game-over triggered after 3 missed hits
- Score counter that resets each round

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Event-driven game logic using visual blocks
- Implementing player input and collision detection
- Tracking player lives and resetting game state
- Designing feedback loops for win/lose conditions

## 🛠 How to Play
1. Download the `.sb3` file from this repository
2. Open it in the [Scratch 3 online editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor)
3. Press the green flag to start the game
4. Use the paddle to bounce the ball — missing 3 times ends the game!
